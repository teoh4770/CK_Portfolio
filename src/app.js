  <p>Hi, I'm Chee, a 21-year-old Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada.</p>

  <p>At 17, I wasn't sure about my future. I talked with my family and realized I always liked computers. I tried learning "data science" with a long Udemy course, but it didn't excite me.</p>
  
  <p>However, I found that I really enjoyed the programming part of the course. It was different from my other studies because I got instant feedback from the programs I made. So, I decided to study Computer Science.</p>
  
  <p>I also discovered that I enjoy problem-solving and creating things. I started by teaching myself web development, and it felt like I had a superpower to build things from scratch.</p>
  
  <p>Now, I'm balancing my Computer Science studies with self-taught web development. I even got a job with a startup's engineering team, where I led a project to create a user interface for a machine. It's been an exciting journey! ðŸ˜„</p>
