          <p>Hey there! I'm Chee, a 21-year-old sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University
            in
            the cozy town of Waterloo, Canada.</p>
          <p>My journey into the programming world kicked off when I was 17, in the midst of some classic teenage
            confusion about my future. I couldn't nail down a major that truly sparked my interest. After some
            heart-to-heart chats with my family, it dawned on me that I'd always been kind of a computer geek. So, I
            initially thought, "Why not try 'data science'?" My big bro kindly bought me this epic, 30+ hour
            introductory
            data science course on Udemy. But surprise, surprise, it turned out to be a total buzzkill for my data
            science
            dreams.</p>
          <p>The silver lining in this story, though, was that I found the coding part of that course super rad. I
            dipped
            my toes into Python, and it was like finding my long-lost twin. The way I learned and got instant feedback
            from the programs I created was a game-changer. That's when I made the big move to dive headfirst into the
            world of Computer Science.</p>
          <p>It also hit me that I have a knack for problem-solving and creating cool stuff from scratch. So, I
            naturally
            veered into the self-taught realm of web development as a starting point. It's like I stumbled upon a
            superpower I never knew I had, building things from scratch.</p>
          <p>Since then, I've been juggling my Computer Science studies with my self-taught web development
            adventures.
            This path also landed me a gig with a startup's engineering team, where I got to lead a frontend project
            and
            cook up a slick user interface for a machine. It's been quite the ride! 😄</p>
