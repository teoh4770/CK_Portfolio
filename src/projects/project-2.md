  This makeup artist portfolio website is a multi-page web platform that serves as an online portfolio and a marketing tool for my sister, who specializes in hairstyling and makeup artistry.

  **What did I build it with?**
  - HTML and CSS for the responsive frontend design.
  - JavaScript for interactive elements, such as menu buttons and an accordion.
  - GSAP library for style transitions and animations.
  - 11ty, a static site generator for faster build times.
  - Netlify for hosting.

### Project Purpose and Goals
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
The aim of this project is to establish a professional online presence for my sister, with the intention of attracting potential clients, displaying her portfolio of work, and promoting her services effectively.  

The primary objectives are: showcasing a gallery of her makeup artistry to highlight her skills and talent, offering comprehensive details about her background, skills, and contact information, and designing a visually engaging, user-friendly website that shows her unique style and professionalism.

### Web Stack and Explanation
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
Since the website doesn't require extensive user interaction, and the UI doesn't frequently update, I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, 11ty and netlify for its development.

HTML and CSS were employed to structure and design the website, ensuring it accurately represented the artist's brand.

For interactive elements, such as image sliders and contact forms, JavaScript was used to introduce interactivity with the DOM elements.

In my pursuit of stylish transitions and animations, I didn't want to reinvent the wheel by relying solely on CSS. Thus, I turned to the GSAP library, a JavaScript library known for building high-performance animations.

Because my goal was to output HTML and CSS files with the shortest load times, I picked 11ty, a static site generator that allowed me to employ templating to break down HTML into smaller, reusable components. This process, in turn, facilitated the generation of HTML files without the need for JavaScript.

After exploring various hosting providers, I ultimately selected Netlify as the ideal choice for my application because it is free and simple to deploy.

### Problem and Thought Process
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
While working on this side project, I encountered several challenges along the way. In retrospect, these obstacles forced me to acquire more knowledge and skills than I initially anticipated.

Given my lack of a design background, I embarked on research regarding the design of a makeup artist website. I sought inspiration from platforms like Awwwards and Dribbble, consolidating my findings in Figma. Eventually, I chose a specific website as a reference point and developed a design system based on it.

Simultaneously, I aimed to ensure the website's mobile responsiveness to reach a broader audience. Through online research on CSS forums, I discovered the mobile-first approach, which helped streamline the entire development process. As a result, I began with the mobile viewport in Figma and gradually expanded to the desktop design.

Upon completing the website, I noticed that it loaded slowly. The culprit was the media assets, such as images and videos, which hindered the site's performance as browsers struggled to render them. To address this issue, I optimized the media assets using tools like Squoosh for image compression and employed Cloudinary for efficient storage and delivery of videos.

### Lessons Learned
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
Despite the headache and the fact that my sister did not use the website by the end of the day, I still learned a lot about managing a large project from beginning to end. I also gained insight into the importance of communication, emphasizing the need to always understand the customer's needs first and maintain ongoing collaboration with them.
