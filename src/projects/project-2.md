  [Pomotama](https://pomotama.netlify.app/) is a Pomodoro timer app inspired by my favorite timer app [Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/). It offers focused Pomodoro timer intervals and personal todo tracker.
  
  I love Pomofocus.io so much that I'm basically using it every day while doing tasks. While it's being really helpful to my productivity flow, I feel like I can improve the app to suit my need more. Therefore, I built this as a side project for both learning purposes and personal usage.

  What did I build it with?
  - Vite as modern web project build tool
  - React.js for building reusable and interactive UI components
  - TypeScript for building business logic
  - Tailwind CSS for rapidly building the style
  - React Testing Library + Jest to ensure the quality of the app and foster faster development process
  - Jotai as global React state management library
  - Driver.js as product tours library to provide tutorial for user

### Project Purpose and Goals
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
  I built this project to further solidify my knowledge of creating a web application and single page application (SPA) development with React. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to implement a SPA web application with React, following React best practice and project architecture. 

  Here are the concepts and patterns I have learnt:
  - Planning web application from general ideas to coding the pages
  - React project architecture
  - Creating custom hooks
  - Exploring React global state management
  - Utilising web worker API for background process
  - Implementing unit tests and component tests
