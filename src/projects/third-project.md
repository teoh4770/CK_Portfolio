### Introduction
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">  
  
  During the summer of 2022, I had the privilege of interning at Nfinite Nanotech in Waterloo, Ontario. working as an Human Machine Interface Developer (HMI Developer, another branch of frontend developer).

### What are the tasks that are assigned to me?
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
  I was entrusted with overseeing the entire HMI project, from its initial planning stage, design stage, to its execution. Working closely with the engineering team, my mission was to ensure that the operator had complete control over the machine's status and operation.

### What are the actions I took?
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">

  I did a few important things to ensure the success of the HMI project. First, I checked out all the documents and requirements to understand what the HMI needed and why it was vital for the machine. I also talked with the engineering team to understand every part of the machine, and how they work together. 

  To create an HMI that met industry standards and was user-friendly and safe, I went with an iterative approach. I kept in touch with the whole machine crew, listened to their ideas, and used them in the HMI design.

  I also spent a good chunk of my time learning the HMI programming language, which had its own tricky API. To get the hang of it, I built and documented the HMI system, making sure to cover the API parts we needed for the project. This helped us work better as a team and made the development process smoother.

### The Results?

  By the end of the internship, I manage to complete the interface within 4 months. The newly created HMI significantly enhanced the user interface and experience, making data integration and interaction smoother and more efficient. It also passed rigorous usability and safety evaluation, meeting the high standards set by the engineering team. Overall, after 70 releases and more than 120 commits, the engineering team manage to work and test the machine with ease. It was a job well done according to them, and I was proud to have played a part in it.

### Lessons Learned
<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
  
  I take pride in the opportunity to collaborate with the engineering team, who have significantly raised my expectations of what is achievable as an intern. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the essence of effective teamwork. I have come to understand the value of being a supportive team member, and I have seen how open and direct communication can boost productivity and foster stronger relationships within a team.
